# Neighbourhood Map

This app shows a listing of local restaurants and cafe's in my area. It utilises the Zomato API to fetch the name, address, user rating, and URL, and the Google Maps API to display restaurants on an interactive map.

The layout is a modified version of [SB Admin 2](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/).
